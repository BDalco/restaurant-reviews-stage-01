# Restaurant Reviews: Stage 1

### Project Overview: Stage 1

Stage 1 of this project is a static website that is updated to a more dynamic responsive website that also is accessible for a screen reader user.  Lastly, a service worker is added to cache static assets of the website to create an offline experience of the website. 

### Instructions to Run Website

1. Download the repository and access the root folder in a terminal on your computer.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
